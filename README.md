EVIS X1 represents a range of new, easy-to-use technologies that aim to revolutionize the way gastrointestinal disorders can be detected, characterized and treated. 

**We want to support every endoscopist.
In every procedure. Every day.**
 
Easier identification of bleeding points makes hemostasis quicker and easier. Visualization of deep blood vessels indicates areas of risk. This helps to reduce physician stress during endoscopic therapy.

The continuously sharp image was developed to reduce the necessity for focal adjustments. This improved visibility helps to make endoscopy more convenient and may even contribute to easier identification and a more confident diagnosis of abnormalities.
 
The EVIS X1 Video System Center contains five LEDs that are combined to produce different observation modes. It includes an Olympus tailored amber LED enabling the visualization capabilities of the RDI mode. LEDs have a longer life span than other light sources while consuming less energy.
 
BAI-MAC (Brightness Adjustment Imaging with MAintenance of Contrast) is a new image processing technique to improve the brightness levels in dark areas of the endoscopic image, whilst maintaining the brightness of lighter areas to increase the distance view.
 
The lightweight and more ergonomic ErgoGrip is designed to increase user comfort and scope handling. It accommodates users with smaller hands with improved accessibility to the angulation controls and remote switches.
 
Pre-freeze analyzes previous images to obtain a clear visual record of the procedure in the shortest possible time (this is an updated algorithm compared to the EVIS EXERA III / EVIS LUCERA ELITE systems).
 
Enabled by the auxiliary water channel, our Water Jet function improves the accuracy of observations and the efficiency of endoscopic treatment by easily removing mucus and other residues in the investigated areas.
 
Processor and light source combined in one box resulting in a more compact and lightweight design, featuring multiple special observation modes that support physicians in every step during endoscopic procedures.

As the world leader in endoscopy, OLYMPUS provides cutting-edge medical technology to healthcare professionals around the globe. In 1950 we started our commitment to research and development with the first gastrocamera, the precursor of the modern videogastroscope. Our collaborative efforts with the medical community improve both the underlying technologies and the quality of patient care. The experience through approximately 800,000 colonoscopies in Australia and New Zealand per annum using Olympus endoscopes and our focus on clinically proven facts make us the top partner for your endoscopy department.
 
The EVIS EXERA III endoscopy system is a leap forward in ease-of-use functionality and state-of-the-art technologies. The result is a system that helps physicians conduct procedures efficiently and helps GI staff members perform setup and reprocessing tasks with ease.
 
Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) is an optical image enhancement technology. It is made up of filtered light that matches the absorption spectrum of the haemoglobin in the blood, enhancing the contrast and visualisation of vessel patterns in the mucosa, for accurate diagnosis of tissue changes.
 
**How it Works**
ScopeGuide is an integrated technology for colonoscopy that provides real-time 3D visualisation of scope position and configuration. This new level of visualisation is a helpful tool during colon insertion and provides physicians with the ability to recognise and resolve loops as they form.

**The Result**
Higher cecal intubation rate and less patient discomfort.
